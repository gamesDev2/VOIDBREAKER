Basic Movement:

W, A, S, D: Move forward, left, backward, and right.
Mouse Movement: Look around (rotate your view).
Jumping:

Spacebar: Jump.
• Supports double jumping (jump once more in air).
• If wall running, pressing Space will perform a wall jump.
Sprinting:

Left Shift (hold): Sprint (increases movement speed).
• Note: Sprinting is only available when grounded.
Crouching & Sliding:

C (hold): Crouch.
• When not sprinting, simply crouch to lower your profile.
Slide:
• While sprinting (holding Left Shift) and grounded, press Left Control to trigger a slide.
• The slide acts like a dash but forces you to remain crouched until you release the crouch key.
Dashing:

E (press): Dash (a quick burst of speed in the movement direction).
• Dash is not available when crouching.
Wall Running:

When airborne and approaching a nearly vertical wall while falling, the player will start wall running automatically.
During wall running, momentum is preserved along the wall.
Press Space to perform a wall jump off the wall.
Rail Riding:

When the player enters a rail trigger area (see Rail object), they “stick” to the top of the rail.
While rail riding, movement is forced along the rail’s direction at high speed.
Press Space to jump off the rail at any time.
